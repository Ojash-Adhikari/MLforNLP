    "    580  i had no intention of using this product; like others, i just got it as part of a bundle that gave me a substantial rebate. since so many other people have written about their problems actually getting the rebate, i figured i should chime in with my experience. if you follow the direction precisely you will get your rebate. just don't ever actually install the software. and put a reminder on your calendar to go and cancel your automatic subscription renewal. their rebate tracking is actually pretty good. it took about two weeks from when i sent it (snail mail) to when their system said they received it. then it took another two weeks for them to approve it. when i filed the rebate i opted for the expedited version which cost me 10% of the rebate (deducted directly from the rebate-no money up front). after approval, they mailed it within four days and a received it a couple of days later. It comes in a completely nondescript envelope so it's easy to miss. But it's a real, live AmEX prepaid gift card. I used it last night in fact. And today I remembered to go cancel my automatic renewal service. Contrary to what some others have said, it took on the first time and wasn't a big deal. I used a throw away email address when I signed up (though I haven't received any email from them since) so it took me longer to figure out what my username was to sign in than it did for me to actually cancel.   \n",
