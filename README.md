Scenario:
You work for an online retail store that wants to improve customer engagement for customers who have posted negative reviews. The company wants to detect negative reviews and assign these reviews to a customer service agent to address.

You are tasked with solving part of this problem by using ML to detect negative reviews. You were given access to a dataset that contains reviews, which have been classified as positive or negative. You will use this dataset to train an ML model to predict the sentiment of new reviews.

The AMAZON-REVIEW-DATA-CLASSIFICATION.csv file contains actual reviews of products, and these reviews include both text data and numeric data. Each review is labeled as positive (1) or negative (0).

The dataset contains the following features:

==reviewText: Text of the review ==summary: Summary of the review ==verified: Whether the purchase was verified (True or False) ==time: UNIX timestamp for the review ==log_votes: Logarithm-adjusted votes log(1+votes) ==isPositive: Whether the review is positive or negative (1 or 0)
